Importing Required Libraries:

sys: Used to access command-line arguments.
pandas (pd): Used for data manipulation and reading the CSV file.
networkx (nx): Used for graph creation and manipulation.
matplotlib.pyplot (plt): Used for graph visualization.
Getting the File Path:

The code checks if the number of command-line arguments is less than 2 (indicating that a file path was not provided).
If no file path is provided, it prints an error message and exits the script.
Otherwise, it assigns the provided file path to the variable file_path.
Reading the Adjacency Matrix:

The code uses pd.read_csv to read the CSV file located at file_path.
The header=None parameter specifies that the CSV file does not have a header row.
The resulting DataFrame is stored in the variable adjacency_matrix.
Creating an Empty Directed Graph:

The code creates an empty directed graph using nx.DiGraph().
This graph will hold the nodes and edges of the graph based on the adjacency matrix.
Adding Nodes to the Graph:

The code extracts the nodes from the first column of the adjacency matrix using adjacency_matrix.iloc[:, 0].
The graph.add_nodes_from function adds the extracted nodes to the graph.
Adding Edges to the Graph:

The code iterates over each row of the adjacency matrix using iterrows().
For each row, it extracts the node name from the first element (node = row[0]).
It then iterates over the remaining elements (edges) in the row, along with their corresponding indices using enumerate(edges).
If the weight of an edge is non-zero, it adds the edge to the graph using graph.add_edge with the source node (node), target node (nodes[j]), and weight (weight).
Drawing and Visualizing the Graph:

The code uses nx.spring_layout to calculate the positions of the nodes for visualization.
It creates a dictionary labels where node names are used as labels for the nodes.
The nx.draw function is used to draw the graph with labels.
The nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels function is used to add edge labels based on the edge weights.
Finally, plt.show() displays the graph visualization.
This code allows you to provide a CSV file path as a command-line argument, reads the adjacency matrix from the CSV file, creates a directed graph, adds nodes and edges based on the adjacency matrix, and then visualizes the graph with labeled nodes and edge weights.
